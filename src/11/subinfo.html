<h1>Introduction</h1><p>Physics is all around us. Everything operates based off of mathmatical equations defined by the way things work. The well known story of Issac Newton and his apple sparks the source of the maths of life, and from this math, techonogies and understandings we take for granted today, were discovered. A favorite pastime of mine is listening to the radio, and the way the radio waves work, is astounding. The ability to transport information through an invisible medium. Radio waves are entirley physics and math, and we seek to break down the way that these waves work.</p>

<h1>Equations of Waves</h1><p>Before analyzing radio waves specifically, the general properties of all waves must be understood. A wave is the rhythmic path that a particle takes in its motion. The particle starts at rest, referred to as the undisturbed position. From this position, that particle takes on a sinusoidal path. It will reach the amplitude, the farthest point away from undisturbed, and then turn back. It will cross its original position in the opposite direction, reach the opposite amplitude and then return to its original y-axis position and direction. Once it is at this point, it has completed one cycle. Cycles are measured in two ways. The length of the cycle, wavelength, is denoted by the Greek symbol lambda ( &lambda; ). The time it takes for a particle to complete a cycle is called the period ( T ). The period of the wave links directly to the frequency ( <i>f</i> ) of the wave, which is how many cycles are completed in one second. Frequency is denoted with the unit Hertz (Hz).</p><p>The equation ( <i>c</i> = <i>f</i>&lambda; = &lambda;/T ) links all the variables together. In English the equation reads: the wave velocity equals the frequency times the wavelength, which equals the wavelength divided by the period. For radio waves, which move close to the speed of light, the constant ( <i>c</i> ) is substituted in. The speed of light in a vacuum is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, which is what c is equal to. When using this equation, because the speed of light is the same for all radio waves, all other properties of a wave can be derived with just one other variable being known.</p>

<h1>How Data Is Transfered</h1><p>AM stands for amplitude modulation. This means that in order to transfer data on an AM frequency, the height of each wave is changed to represent the data being transferred. This method uses the wave's transverse properties to represent changes in data. To transfer binary code this way, an AM receiver would measure the height of the sinusoid. The varying heights of the wave each represent ones and zeroes, where the taller amplitude is a one, and the shorter amplitude is a zero. To transfer voice or music, a converter measures the frequency and amplitude of a sound wave, and converts it to the frequency and amplitude to a radio wave. The larger sound wave moves up and down, at its frequency, and the radio wave fills the sound wave by replicating the original amplitude at its own much smaller frequency. AM stations broadcast on a large wavelength, which allows it to travel long distances. However, the less frequent data points make its signal weaker, and limits it carrying power to talk shows and news stations.</p><p>FM stands for frequency modulation. This means that in order to represent data, the wave's frequency is changed. This method uses the wave's longitudinal changes to represent data. To transfer binary data for example, a zero would be represented by a large gap in between two amplitudes, and a one would be represented by a small gap in between two amplitudes. To transfer audio the wave's frequency decreases as the amplitude of the sound wave decreases and the wave's frequency increases as the sound wave's amplitude increases. The slinky laid out on the floor discussed earlier would represent frequency modulation on a more basic scale. </p><button class='see-more' onclick='seeMore(4)'>Go Back...</button>

<h1>How Data Is Transfered</h1><p>There are two types of waves, transverse and longitudinal waves. Transverse waves' disturbances occur perpendicular to the direction. This is best displayed by rippling water, which moves up and down away from the point the wave started. Longitudinal waves have disturbances that occur parallel, or in the same direction as the wave. This is best displayed by a slinky laid flat on the ground. If a person pushes one end towards the other and pulls back, a ripple of scrunched slinky will move through the stretched slinky.</p><p>Radio waves can transfer data and sound. The digital message that a phone sends over a text message has been translated from the original binary series of ones and zeros into a wave. The music or voice that a radio station or phone transfers has been translated from its original sound frequency into a new light frequency. Sound waves move at a velocity of 340 meters per second and have a frequency between 100 to 12,000 Hz. Light travels faster and is more frequent than sound. Because of this, when converted, the frequency must be replicated differently, and the altered for the difference in velocity. The modification of the wave accounts for the frequency difference and the velocity difference by modifying it in such a way, that when received, it can easily be converted back into sound. Each of these types of waves is transferred differently, depending on which way the wave changes form to represent change, transverse or longitudinal.</p><button class='see-more' onclick='seeMore(3)'>Continue...</button>
